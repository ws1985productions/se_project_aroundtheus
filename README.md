# Project 6: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

Sprints 5 and 6 Code

Within Sprint 5, I have added functionality with the Edit Profile and Add Image button, as well as, functionality for the photo preview.

Within Sprint 6, I have added validation for the Edit Profile and Add Image forms. It now has parameters for the information that is entered and will give error messages if it does not meet the requirements. Within this sprint, there was code added to close out of the pop-ups using the "Escape" key and clicking outside of the pop-up.


Older section of the project

In this 3rd project, I will be using Figma designs to help understand and create this Instrgram like website. I will also being include the use of a new apsect of CSS called media queries, media queries allow for the site to be rendered on different screen sizes to allow for the perfect looking site on all types of devices. I also decided to use the flex layout versus using grind for a smoother flow to the columns and rows that make up the site.

Intro

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. This is to show how websites respond to different screen sizes. This project covers design layouts such as grid and flexbox, while using media queuries to size the page appropriately for different screen sizes.
