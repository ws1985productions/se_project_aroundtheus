# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

In this 3rd project, I will be using Figma designs to help understand and create this Instrgram like website. I will also being include the use of a new apsect of CSS called media queries, media queries allow for the site to be rendered on different screen sizes to allow for the perfect looking site on all types of devices. I also decided to use the flex layout versus using grind for a smoother flow to the columns and rows that make up the site.
